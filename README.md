# 🧭 WPI CS5008 – Introduction to Systems and Network Programming

This repository contains my **coursework projects and assignments** for the graduate-level course  
**CS5008: Systems Programming Concepts** at **Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)**.  
It demonstrates hands-on experience with low-level systems programming, process management, concurrency, and memory systems in C.
